			<p>The National Center for Education Statistics periodically administers the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to test the knowledge and skills of the nation's students in grades 4, 8, and 12. Students in private schools consistently score well above the national average. At all three grades a significantly higher percentage of private school students score at or above the Basic, Proficient, and Advanced levels than public school students. Below are the results from the most recent NAEP report cards.<a href="http://www.capenet.org/facts.html">(source)</a></p>

			<p>It seems all the time that we hear on the news of acts of violence and bullying in public schools. Holiness Christian Academy is dedicated to the safety of your children. No outsiders are allowed in the building when school is in session. The ratio of students to teachers is low so that teachers can monitor student behavior for bullying. Our Christian environment encourages courteous interaction between students.</p>

		<h2>Education with a Biblical Foundation</h2>
		<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>From prayer in the morning to afternoon chapels, the students are constantly encouraged to grow in their faith and in their love for God and one another. The A.C.E. curriculum that we use employs Bible memorization and a strong, Christian worldview. We agree that <a href="http://www.worldmag.com/2014/09/why_christian_education">&ldquo;Genuine Christian education seeks to integrate God’s Word into every facet of the curriculum as well as all co-curricular activities.&rdquo;</a></p>
			<p>We believe that education has to deal with the heart and not just the mind. As <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/biblestudies/articles/churchhomeleadership/060719.html">an article</a> in Christianity Today says, &ldquo;Christian education has the authority to speak about more than this visible world, the world that is passing away. Secular education can focus on business and money, matter and molecules, people and issues, but the Christian educator can move beyond to the soul, the human spirit, life after death, the kingdom of God, the return of Christ, the final judgment—things that last.&rdquo;</p>
